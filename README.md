# Project Name
## RL-Based Employee Mental Health Monitoring System in Modern Workplace Environment

## Quick Overview
Mental health issues are a growing concern, impacting individuals' well-being and productivity. This project introduces a Deep Quantum Network (DQN)-based Mental Health Prediction System, designed to assess users' mental health status based on their inputs through a Streamlit UI. Users provide responses related to factors such as work environment, personal history, and mental health-related experiences. The DQN model processes these inputs to generate a prediction, indicating whether the user may be experiencing mental health challenges. To enhance user engagement, the system provides dynamic visualizations based on the prediction results, offering insights into patterns and contributing factors affecting mental well-being. Additionally, a mental wellness chatbot is integrated, allowing users to seek guidance, self-care tips, and mental health resources. The chatbot serves as a supportive tool, offering proactive mental health assistance and recommendations. This project leverages cutting-edge AI, quantum computing principles, and deep learning techniques to improve mental health awareness and provide users with an interactive and informative experience. By combining predictive modeling, real-time visualization, and conversational AI, the system empowers individuals to take proactive steps toward mental well-being while fostering awareness and accessibility to mental health support
